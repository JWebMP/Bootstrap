/**
 * Cards
 * <p>
 * A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual
 * background colors, and powerful display options.
 * <p>
 * If you’re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is
 * available as modifier classes for cards.
