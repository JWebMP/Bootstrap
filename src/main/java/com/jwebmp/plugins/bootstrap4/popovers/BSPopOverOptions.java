 * Popovers rely on the 3rd party library Tether for positioning. You must include tether.min.js before bootstrap.js in order for popovers

 * <p>
 * Popovers require the tooltip plugin as a dependency.
 * <p>
 * Popovers are opt-in for performance reasons, so you must initialize them yourself.
 * <p>
 * Zero-length title and content values will never show a popover.
 * <p>
 * Specify container: 'body' to aJ rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).
 * <p>
 * Triggering popovers on hidden elements will not work.
 * <p>
 * Popovers for .disabled or disabled elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.
 * <p>
 * When triggered from hyperlinks that span multiple lines, popovers will be centered. Use white-space: nowrap; on your as to aJ this
